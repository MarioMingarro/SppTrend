\title{Quick summary of climate trends and species occurrences}
\usage{
get_fast_info(data_with_spp, nc_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_with_spp}{A data frame containing at least \code{lon}, \code{lat}, and \code{year} columns.}

\item{nc_path}{Character. Path to the .nc (NetCDF) file containing climate data.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame with annual temperature values per point.
Displays a composite plot showing the geographic distribution and the thermal trend with its corresponding global slope and p-value.
}
\description{
This function performs a rapid diagnostic of the environmental
context by linking species occurrence coordinates with climate NetCDF data.
It extracts the complete climate time-series for all occupied locations,
generating a spatial distribution map and a temporal trend analysis.
