Description: Provides a methodology to analyze how species occurrences change over time, particularly in relation to spatial and thermal factors. It facilitates the development of explanatory hypotheses about the impact ofenvironmental shifts on species by analyzing historical presence data that includes temporal and geographic information. Approach described in Lobo et al., 2023 <doi:10.1002/ece3.10674>.
